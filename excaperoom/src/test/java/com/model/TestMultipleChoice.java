/*  
    when making this tester, I realized there are no existing getter methods
    in the multiplechoice class, meaning there's not an easy way for me to
    check if some things actually work, and I figured that it would go
    against the nature of the tests to just add getter methods, so I'm
    reporting the lack of getter methods as an issue in github
